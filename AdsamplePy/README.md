# AdSamplePy-Project

Welcome to the AdSamplePy-Project - a trustworthy and guaranteed harmless demonstration of installer tricks!

## About

This project aims to illustrate how easily the massive amounts of text in ordinary installers can be misused to trick people into installing unwanted software on their computers and devices.

## How It Works

The project uses simple and harmless Python scripts as the main application, along with small, harmless adware-simulating additional apps offered as "additional downloadables" during installation.

Further details about the simulation: 
The simulation consists of a main Python application and several "additional downloadables". During the installation process, users are presented with seemingly harmless options to install extra tools. The project demonstrates how these tools, if installed, could potentially:

- Change browser settings
- Collect user data
- Run background processes
- et cetera ...

NOTE: All actions are simulated and no actual harmful operations are performed.

## Important Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. None of the simulated actions are actually performed, and we strongly advise against implementing such features in real applications.

## Installation and Usage

Instructions on how to install and run the project:

Currently, the project is in development. Once completed, installation and usage instructions will be provided here. Expected steps will include:

- Cloning the repository
- Installing required dependencies
- Running the main Python script

Stay tuned for detailed instructions as the project progresses
